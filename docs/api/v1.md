# Debug
The debugger can be attached to at most one process or binary. Attaching produces a `debugId` which must be used in all `/debug` routes
to identify the debugging session. If the debugger is not attached to the `debugId` session, these endpoints respond with `409 Conflict`. None of the `/debug` routes respond with `409` for any other reason.

## Example Usage
This example shows one use case of the `/debug` endpoints to give some context about how the API should be used. Return objects
may have some fields omitted for brevity.

 1. Attach to binary at path `/home/hello`:
    1. Request `POST /api/v1/debug/attach/bin/home/hello`
    2. Response: AttachInfo `{id: 1, sourcePath"/home/src"}`
 2. Get directory info and source code
    1. Request `GET /api/v1/filesystem/home/src`
    2. Response: File `{fType: "directory", contents:[{fType: "file", name: "hello.cpp"}]}`
    3. Request `GET /files/home/src/hello.cpp`
    4. Response: Binary contents of `hello.cpp`
 3. Get list of all functions
    1. Request `GET /api/v1/debug/1/functions`
    2. Response: List of Functions `[{address: 54, name:"add" sourcePath: "/home/src/hello.cpp", parameters: [{id: 0, name: "a"}, {id: 1, name: "b"}], localVariables=[{id: 2, name: "sum"}]}]`
 4. Set breakpoint on function
    1. Request `PUT /api/v1/debug/1/breakpoints/54`
    2. Response: Breakpoint `{function: 54}`
 5. Execute program
    1. Request: `POST /api/v1/debug/1/execute`, body: `{args: "2 3"}`
    2. Response: Execution `{id: 16, eType: "process", status: "executing"}`
    3. Debugger begins executing the program, tracking and storing only stdout because this is a `process` execution.
 6. Get process output
    1. Request `GET /api/v1/debug/1/executions/16/trace`
    2. Response: List of traces:
    
        ````
        [
           {index: 0, tType: 1, data: { output: "Calculating 2+3: \n"},
           {index: 1, tType: 2, data: { cause: "breakpoint", nextExecution: 17}
        ]
        ````
        
       This response streams line-by-line as output is generated. When the debugger hits the previously set breakpoint, begins a new
       execution for the new function. Then it adds the `termination` trace and closes the response.
 7. Get execution information and function information and source code (so we can switch to "debugger view" on the client)
    1. Request `GET /api/v1/debug/1/executions/17`
    2. Response: Execution `{id: 17, eType: "function", status: "executing", data: {function: 54}}`
    3. Request `GET /api/v1/debug/1/functions/54`
    4. Response: Function `{address: 54, name:"add" sourcePath: "/home/src/hello.cpp", parameters: [{id: 0, name: "a"}, {id: 1, name: "b"}], localVariables=[{id: 2, name: "sum"}]}`
    1. Request `GET /files/home/src/hello.cpp`
    2. Response: Binary contents of `hello.cpp`
 8. Get function trace
    1. Request `GET /api/v1/debug/1/executions/17/trace`
    2. Response: List of traces:
       
        ```
        [
           {index: 0, tType: 0, data: { state: [{variable: 0, value: 2},{variable: 1, value: 3}]},
           {index: 1, tType: 1, data: { output: "Adding..."},
           {index: 2, tType: 0, data: { state: [{variable: 2, value: 5}]},
           {index: 3, tType: 2, data: { cause: "ended", returnValue: 5 }
        ]
        ```
       
 9. The program is paused at after the function has completed execution. The user may call `POST /api/v1/debug/1/execute` to continue execution.

## Executions
An execution represents a chunk of program state and output produced as the program is run. There are two types of Executions--`function`, which is a fully traceable, debuggable execution, and `process`, which only contains `stdout` trace objects.

“Function” executions are produced when the process hits a breakpoint or the user executes a standalone function.
“Process” executions are produced by the `/debug/execute` endpoint. If the execution enters a function with a breakpoint, it terminates and creates a new “function” execution, setting the `nextExecution` field to point to the new function execution.

### `GET/debug/:debugId/executions`
Get a list of executions since we attached to this process. The server may delete executions data from the current process at any time.

Responses:
 - `200`
    - Returns {[Execution](#execution)[]}

 - `400`: Invalid execution id
    - Returns {[Error](#error)]}
 - `404`: Execution id not found
    - Returns {[Error](#error)]}


### `GET /debug/:debugId/executions/:executionId/trace`
Get trace data for the execution.

Path parameters:
 - `executionId`: Execution id

Responses:
 - `200`
    - Returns a stream of {[Trace](#trace)[]}. The body begins with an open bracket `[` on its own line. Each Trace is on its own line. If the execution is still `executing`, new lines will be streamed as they are produced. When the execution is finished the last Trace object has `tType=2 (termination)` and describes how the execution terminated. The final line of the body contains `]`, then the response is closed.
 - `400`: Invalid execution id
    - Returns {[Error](#error)]}
 - `404`: Execution id not found
    - Returns {[Error](#error)]}


### `POST /debug/:debugId/executions/:executionId/stop`

- `1`: Internal server error.

TODO: create error codes for more or less every unique error the system can produce. Not part of the prototype, maybe we won’t end up doing this in the final product.
